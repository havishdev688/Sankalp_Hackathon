/**
 * Simple Demo User Creation Script
 * 
 * This is a simplified version that can be run directly in the browser console
 * or as a Node.js script without requiring environment variables.
 * 
 * Note: This version uses the public Supabase client, so it will only work
 * if you have admin access or if you modify the RLS policies temporarily.

    "My elderly mother fell victim to this pattern. She doesn't understand English well and got confused by the interface.",
    "The RBI guidelines should be enforced more strictly. Companies are still using these tricks.",
