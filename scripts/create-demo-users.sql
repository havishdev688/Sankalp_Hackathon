-- Demo Users Creation Script for Ethical Subscription Pillar
-- 
-- This SQL script creates realistic demo users representing different segments
-- of Indian users who are affected by dark UX patterns in digital subscriptions.
--
-- Run this script in your Supabase SQL editor or database console.
-- Note: This script creates users in the auth.users table directly, which requires
-- admin privileges or service role access.

-- First, let's create the demo users in the auth.users table
-- Note: In production, you would typically use the Supabase Admin API
-- This is a simplified approach for demo purposes

-- Create demo users (this requires admin access to auth.users table)
-- For security reasons, we'll create a function that can be called with proper permissions

-- Function to create demo users
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_demo_users()
